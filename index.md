### What is it for?
This is an office building designed to accommodate over 1000 employees. Structurally, it had the goal of accessibility in mind. Employees were kept close together so they would have easy access to eachother. Walkways were easy to navigate so employees could easily get to the nearby coffee shops or train station. Walls and private spaces were reduced in favor of an open layout, promoting the accessibility of each employee to the group atmosphere. This is meant to relax the employees, resembling a settlement or communal street. Relaxed and happy employees are important for the management, who want to retain some hard to find personell relocating from Amsterdam. The design was also very open and transparent. The idea was to educate those walking through about the structural makeup and functions of the building around them.

Notice the cars parked under the building in the bottom. This building had a more open floorplan that allowed a connection with the outside, but this would change in later buildings as terrorism in The Netherlands became more of a concern.

These connected boxes form natural pathways in a grid-like manner, only tilted at an axis from the parking lot and train station.
